/* Always do the hub lookups using the business key to avoid the rare risk
     of hash collisions. If two business keys produce the same hash key, 
     a lookup on the hash key would return that the hash key already exists in the target. 
     But due to the hash collision, this would mean a different business key.
     However, in the case of a hash collision, this will result in a primary key constraint
     violation when inserting the record in the next step. This is not the preferred solution,
     but it is the desired one, because weâ€™d like to be notified in case of collision.
